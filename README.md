# TaskTrack API

A minimal personal task tracker API built with Laravel.  
This project is part of my backend-focused Laravel learning path.

It covers authentication with Sanctum, CRUD endpoints, request validation, filtering, and feature tests.

# Clone and enter the project directory
git clone <repo-url>
